 *   - seed never truncates: the roster baseline only ever applies values; a

 *   - truncate only from the subscribed frame: rows with seq > lastSeq are
 *     dropped ONLY when the server tells us (members_subscribed), which is the

 *
 * faceOf() exposes a useSyncExternalStore-shaped view per (slug, key) whose
