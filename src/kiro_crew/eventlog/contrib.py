"""Contribution protocol: the gateway side of an out-of-process contributor.

Implements ``docs/system-specs/modules/contribution-protocol.md``. Three pieces
live here, and the HTTP handlers, the WebSocket hub and app teardown are thin
callers of them:

``UnitRegistry``
    Which unit kinds have a log. A kind is a REGISTRATION -- ``{kind, id_field,
    frame, service}`` -- so adding a second kind is one ``register_unit`` call
    rather than a rewrite of the routes. Today: ``member``.

``ExternalProjectionStore``
    One row per ``(kind, id, key)`` published from outside, with higher-seq-wins
    and a ``stateVersion`` override, plus an optional render schema per key.
    Durable, because a contributor publishes at its own cadence: an in-memory
    table would drop every contributed card on a gateway restart and leave the
    Members page blank until the contributor happened to re-fold.

``EventBudget``
    Per app, per unit, per UTC day. Deliberately process memory: the budget
    bounds one gateway's exposure to a runaway contributor, and a restart is
    already the loudest possible signal that the process is not the one that
    counted. Persisting it would buy a stricter bound on a resource (log bytes)
    that the 64 KiB per-event cap already bounds.

Nothing here executes contributor code. A contributor reads events, folds in its
own process, and publishes whole values; the gateway stays the only writer of
every log.

#: Serialized size cap for one event's ``data`` (contract §4).
MAX_EVENT_DATA_BYTES = 64 * 1024

#: How large ONE unit's contribution file may be before it is read as unreadable.
#: The caps above bound what a contributor may PUBLISH, which bounds what this
#: file should ever hold -- but the file is a cache on disk, not a value in hand,
#: so nothing stops something else from writing it larger. This is the only bound
#: that can run before the read allocates.
MAX_STORE_FILE_BYTES = 8 * 1024 * 1024

#: Serialized size cap for one published projection ``value``. Not in the
#: contract's §5 prose, but a projection is a WHOLE value pushed to every
#: dashboard socket, so leaving it unbounded would let a contributor make the
#: Members page unloadable. Ten times the event cap: a folded view legitimately
#: summarises many events.
MAX_PROJECTION_VALUE_BYTES = 640 * 1024

#: Default per-app, per-unit, per-day event budget (contract §4).
DEFAULT_EVENT_BUDGET_PER_DAY = 10_000

#: Most distinct projection keys one app may hold on one unit.
#:
#: The event budget above bounds a RATE and resets daily; this bounds STANDING
#: state and so cannot reset, because every stored key is written to the unit's
#: contrib file and shipped in every roster response for that member. A grant is
#: a namespace prefix (`<app>/*`), so without a cap one contributor publishing a
#: fresh key per fold grows the roster payload and the file without limit, and
#: the daily event budget does not bound it: one append can publish one new key,
#: and the keys persist after the day rolls over.
#:
#: Generous on purpose -- a contributor legitimately renders a few dozen rows --
#: so hitting it means a key is being MINTED rather than updated.
MAX_PROJECTION_KEYS_PER_UNIT = 200

#: Characters in one render-schema selector. Bounded because a selector is
#: RETAINED in the stored schema and shipped to the browser on every frame, and
#: capping only the selector COUNT leaves 32 slots that can each hold megabytes.
#: Over-long selectors are REFUSED rather than truncated: a selector names a path
#: into the published value, so a shortened one silently names a different path.
MAX_SELECTOR_CHARS = 200

#: Selectors one render schema may name. Was a bare ``[:32]`` slice in three
#: places, which silently DROPPED the rest -- and a dropped selector changes what
#: the card renders just as a shortened one does, so it is refused instead.
MAX_SCHEMA_SELECTORS = 32

#: Bytes a normalized render schema can reach. DERIVED, not chosen: every field
#: the schema retains carries its own cap, so their composition is the bound --
#: 32 selectors of MAX_SELECTOR_CHARS, a 120-character title, and one enum kind,
#: plus JSON punctuation. Stated so a field added later has to be counted here.
MAX_SCHEMA_BYTES = MAX_SCHEMA_SELECTORS * (MAX_SELECTOR_CHARS + 4) + 120 + 64

#: Characters in one contributed event TYPE. The type is retained verbatim in
#: every envelope the append writes, and the namespace pattern it must match
#: bounds its shape but not its length.
MAX_EVENT_TYPE_CHARS = 120

#: Characters in a projection's IDENTITY fields -- its key and its owning app.
#:
#: The sibling caps above bound what a row CONTAINS; these two are what a row
#: IS, and they are retained just as long: the key is a JSON object key in the
#: unit's contrib file and is shipped in every roster response, and the app name
#: rides beside it. Capping the value and the key COUNT leaves 200 slots whose
#: names can each hold megabytes.
#:
#: REFUSED rather than truncated, for the reason :data:`MAX_SELECTOR_CHARS`
#: gives and one worse: a shortened selector names a different path, and a
#: shortened KEY can land on a key another app already holds, so truncating
#: would turn an over-long name into a silent overwrite of someone else's row.
MAX_PROJECTION_IDENTITY_CHARS = 200

#: Rows one unit's contrib FILE may hold in total, across every app in it.
#:
#: :data:`MAX_PROJECTION_KEYS_PER_UNIT` is charged per app, which is a true bound
#: at publish time because an authenticated contributor cannot mint a second app
#: identity. On the LOAD path the app name is read from the file, so the writer
#: picks the bucket key and a per-app cap is not an aggregate cap at all. This is
#: the ceiling that holds whoever writes the file.
#:
#: Deliberately far above the per-app cap: a unit legitimately carries rows from
#: several contributors, so this bounds the FILE without constraining honest use.
MAX_PROJECTION_KEYS_PER_FILE = 2_000

#: Largest ``seq`` or ``stateVersion`` a publish may carry.
#:
#: Higher wins, and a Python int has no width, so a single publish carrying 10**60
#: pins the row at a value no honest fold can ever advance past -- the contributor
#: freezes that key for good, and a refold or a teardown-and-republish cannot take
#: it back. The number is also retained: it is written to the contrib file and
#: shipped in every roster response, so an arbitrary-precision integer is an
#: unbounded retained field like any other.
#:
#: 2**53-1 is the ceiling because these values cross to a browser as JSON, where
#: they land in a double; anything past it is not representable there anyway.
MAX_PROJECTION_SEQ = 2**53 - 1

#: How deeply a published value or an event's ``data`` may nest.
#:
#: A BYTE cap does not bound depth: a thousand nested empty lists is about two
#: kilobytes, far inside the 64 KiB event cap, and the network-boundary redactor
#: that scrubs this payload before it reaches a browser RECURSES over it. Past
#: the interpreter's own recursion limit that redactor raises instead of
#: returning, so unbounded depth is what turns a size-legal payload into a
#: failure of the one control standing between agent-authored text and the
#: dashboard. Bounded HERE, at the point of acceptance, so the depth that
#: defeats the redactor can never be persisted and replayed on every read.
#:
#: Far above any real fold: a rendered card is a handful of levels deep.
MAX_JSON_DEPTH = 32

#: Render kinds a published schema may name (contract §7).
SCHEMA_KINDS = frozenset({"badge", "text", "list", "table", "keyvalue"})

#: The HTTP status each contract §9 error code answers with. ONE table, so a

#: also what lets the repo's error-code contract test verify statically that
