"""One member's append-only log, stored as a ``member``-kind crew log.

This module is an ADAPTER, not a log implementation. The bytes, the locking, the
durability and the repair all belong to :mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.store`, which
already owns them for the ``crew`` and ``session`` kinds::

    <data home>/crew-log/members/<store name>/log.jsonl

A member's log is a third KIND there rather than a second mechanism beside it.
That is the whole point of this file being thin: the ``crew-log`` root is masked
from the sandbox and fenced against the agent file tools (``security/paths.py``,
``sandbox.py``), named at the root so every kind inherits it. A per-member log
stored anywhere else would need its own fence entry, and the next log added would
miss it the same way -- an append-only record the agent can rewrite is not an
append-only record, and that property has to hold by WHERE THE FILE LIVES rather
than by someone remembering to list it.

One translation lives here and nowhere else, so nothing above this layer changes:

**Contributed event types.** A crew log keeps exactly one guest TYPE namespace,
``app:<name>/<action>``, and grants it to the ``member`` kind. The contribution
protocol spells the same thing ``<app>/<action>``. The stored form takes the
``app:`` prefix so the log's own ownership rule decides the write, and the read
gives the protocol spelling back, so an app's declared ``contributions.events``
and every frame carrying them are untouched.

        appending to one member at the same instant do not serialize behind the
        per-append lock: the second is refused ``already_owned`` and writes nothing.
        The member log has two ordinary writers -- the gateway, and ``kirocrew-core``
        recording activity from its own process, which
        :meth:`refresh_if_changed` already names on the read side -- so the
        collision is routine and the lost event is a transition missing from history
        for good.

        The lease module tells a refused caller to report the loss rather than retry
        it, on the stated ground that it will not own the log by asking again in a
        moment. That ground holds for a LONG-LIVED holder such as the session
        emitter's cached handle. It does not hold here, and that is measured rather
        than assumed: this class releases within the append that took it, because the
        reload below replaces the handle the claim was bound to, and a test asserts
        this process holds no lease after ensure, after two appends or after a read.
        A holder that momentary is precisely one worth waiting for, so waiting is
        what this does -- for a bounded time, and only for that one code.

        Retrying is safe because the store refuses BEFORE it writes: its own append
        contract says a rejected append leaves the file identical, and the lease
        says a refused caller has written nothing. So no attempt can double-write.
        Exhausting the budget re-raises, which leaves the callers' existing
        reporting in place rather than swallowing the loss quietly.
