"""Who may read, append and publish on a unit's log.

One question per function, each answered from the app's own manifest
``contributions`` declaration and nothing else. The HTTP handlers and the
WebSocket hub both call these, so the answer cannot differ between the two
surfaces.

Three properties are deliberate:

* **Disabled means denied.** An app token survives a disable (the secret is not
  rotated), so every answer here first asks whether the app is enabled --
  mirroring ``ws_event_scope.app_events_revoked``, which exists for the same
  reason on the frame side.
* **Reading is per kind, not per event type** (contract §2). A subscriber sees
  every event of a unit it may subscribe to, which is why the contract puts
  sensitive data in the durable store an event points at rather than in the
  event.
* **The prefix rule is re-checked at use, not trusted from install.** A manifest
  is a file on disk that an app trusted to run code can rewrite, so a pattern
  that does not begin with the app's own name is ignored here even though
  ``AppManifest.validate`` would have refused it at install time.
